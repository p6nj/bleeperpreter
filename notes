Bleeperpreter Syntax Tree (vars title-ized, var assignment: ">", errors: "!", escapes: "\", contextual OR: "|", value transformation/generation: "=", go back x chars: "BACK(x)", other char: "*", if needed: "?")
- tag override is possible
- consider adding support for negative tempi (song will go back in time, maybe an easter egg)
- having new line chars in channel names would be weird and make them difficult to call back in global effect brackets
- all intra-channel modifiers should be case insensitive
